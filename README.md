# read-sheets: a sheet music reading library
Very early stages, but I'm playing around with sheet music reading using the [deepscores dataset](https://tuggeluk.github.io/deepscores/
)

`mido.py` will eventually have some simple midi interfacing functions, and might also handle simpler file writing.



links I'm referring to as I work are in `notes`
